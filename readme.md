I have 3 Project ideas for the Capstone project and me and my mentor have already settled on one because I was so excited to start this project. 
1. A application that is a map of the whole world. and when you click on a specific part of the world you will be able to see specific facts of that country, but the main part of this is you get to see the most eaten dish in that country.
2. A sports app that tells you updates on a game, football games that is on or will be on soon, and many more. 
3. A car app that will teach you how to fix specific parts of your car and will tell you how to define what the issue is on your vehicle.

We ended up going with number 2 because it seemed the most interesting and the API that we found was great. Overall I feel the other apps would be something I will have to do later. But I am happy with the ideas that I came up with.
